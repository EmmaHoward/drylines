canny_mod.py             contains base edge/ridge detection algorithms
drylines.py              contains useful routines and functions to apply algorithms
get_input.py             downloads era5_nearsurface_2016.nc 
identify_cab_kd.py       finds CAB and KD in 1 month of ERA-5 reanalysis

To get started with a test case, set up the copernicus web api (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to) if you haven't already.
You'll need to register to do this. 
Install dependencies, including iris, basemap, cmocean and skimage. skimage is a must
(of these, only skimage is truly required. You can fairly easily remove the former three packages by editing the code)
Then you can run get_input.py to download some sample data. 
Running identify_cab_kd.py will then identify drylines and convergence lines in the sample data. 
It does so by importing code from drylines.py, which in turn imports from canny_mod.py, so make sure these are in the same directory. 
You won't need to run canny_mod.py or drylines.py directly.


Note: the Kalahari Discontinuity (KD) was previously referred to as the Trans-Kalahari Discontinuity (TKD) before it was pointed out to 
me that not every acronym needs three letters. Some instances of tkd may still exist in the code and/or doc.
